      content="Hey developers! I'm hyped to share my brand spanking new portfolio with you. Built using React, TypeScript, Jotai, and Tailwind, it's a slick and stylish showcase of my skills and experiences. No more relying on just my GitHub overview, I decided to level up! Take a peek at the live demo and see what I've been cooking up."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
